          <p><strong>Facebook today...</strong></p>
          <p>Facebook today has over 3 billion users and an annual revenue of 70 billion dollars! Where does all this money come from? <strong>Facebook Ads.</strong></p>
          <p><img src={m1} alt="fb ads" /></p>
          <p>Having over 3 billion users worldwide makes Facebook the biggest platform for companies to advertise and market for their products. It is also used by politicians to run their campaigns during elections.</p>
          <p><strong>Where did it start to go wrong...</strong></p>
          <p>Facebook had come under scrutiny during the Cambridge Analytica Scandal. Here is what had happened.</p>
          <p>Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian American who worked at Cambridge Analytica, had made a Facebook app: a quiz. This quiz was used to not only steal data of the users who took the quiz but it also allowed Cambridge Analytica to gain raw data of the Facebook friends of those who took the quiz. This was possible because of a loophole found in the Facebook API (Application Programming Interface). Raw data of 87 million Americans users was leaked from Facebook by just a quiz made by some third party developer.</p>
          <p>This data was sold by Cambridge Analytica during political campaigns (Trump Campaign and Brexit) and was used to mislead Facebook users through manipulative campaign ads and analyzing behavioral patterns using sensitive data of their users. Reports show that these questionable ads posted on Facebook tipped the American presidential elections in Donald Trump&#39;s favor and also had an effect on Brexit results. When news about the leak was broken to the world by whistle blower Christopher Wylie, Facebook came under a microscope for not being able to protect data of millions of Americans. The Cambridge Analytica firm closed it&#39;s operations that year as a result of the scandal.</p>
          <p><img src={m2} alt="Cambridge analytica" /></p>
          <p>Through 2015 elections, Facebook had actually been ramping up its internal focus on elections as a revenue generating opportunity, growing the headcount of staff working directly with politicians to encourage them to use their platform and tools for campaigning. So they can hardly claim they weren’t aware of the value of user data for political targeting.</p>
          <p>Not only was data breach an issue, but also the use of false, hateful, racist and misleading ads by the Trump Campaign that majorly lead to his victory. This became a point of concern. Since then, there have been next to zero changes to prevent false and hateful ads from being uploaded on Facebook, or any changes that would prevent the misleading or hateful posts from reaching its users.</p>
          <p><strong>&quot;The Cambridge Analytica scandal changed the world – but it didn&#39;t change Facebook.&quot; - The Guardian</strong></p>
          <p><strong>What&#39;s happening during the pandemic...</strong></p>
          <p>Due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, a pool of false ads have surfaced on Facebook. These ads have sparked racist theories, promoted dangerous home remedies and also falsely promoted wrong medicines and vaccines as cure to the virus. This has led to an increase in frustration in the health sector from all over the world, as they are working day and night for not only developing a cure, but also in trying to control the outbreak. With such disruptive ads the situation is only becoming more and more difficult to control.</p>
          <p><img src={m4} alt="ad2" /><img src={m4} alt="ad1" /></p>
          <p>These incidents have added to the previous long list of sectors where Facebook ads are being used for hate speech and misinformation, for example white supremacy, vaccine misinformation, violent conspiracies, antisemitism etc.</p>
          <p><strong>About the boycott...</strong></p>
          <p>A campaign was started a few weeks ago - <strong>&quot;<a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">Stop Hate for Profit</a>&quot;</strong>. It condemned how Facebook allowed posts that incited violence on protesters fighting for racial justice; named publications affiliated with white nationalist groups as trusted news sources; turned a blind eye on voter suppression, in its call for a widespread boycott. The movement took off within a few weeks and many companies have joined this campaign since. These companies have stopped advertising on Facebook to spread a message and to bring about a change in the way ads are being used to spread hate.</p>
          <p><img src={m3} alt="stophateforprofit" /><img src={m5} alt="hate2" /></p>
          <p>Over 400 companies have now officially boycotted Facebook and this number is expected to rise. This outrage has seen a dip in the stock price of Facebook whose 99% revenue is through its marketing platform. Some of the biggest names include :-</p>
          <p><img src={m6} alt="companies" /></p>
          <p>So far, Mark Zuckerberg has shown signs that he is prepared to listen; Facebook announced it would begin to tag hateful content. But he believes that these companies will be back soon, indicating that the largest social media company has no intentions of bringing in major changes in their ads policies or to the rules and regulations for their posts.</p>
          <p><strong>Domino Effect...</strong></p>
          <p>Elsewhere, others are taking action of their own.</p>
          <p>Reddit has banned The_Donald forum as part of a wider crackdown on &quot;subreddits&quot;, whose members had engaged in harassment and threatening behavior. The community was not officially linked to the President, but had widely helped spread memes that supported him, before Reddit took steps to limit the posts&#39; reach. In addition, Twitch has temporarily banned an account run by the Trump campaign. The Amazon-owned video-streaming site said two videos of Donald Trump&#39;s rallies that were shown on its platform had broken its rules on hateful conduct.</p>
          <p><strong>Facebook&#39;s point of view...</strong></p>
          <p>Although the company does not support hateful posts and ads on their platform, the top 10 spenders on Facebook only account for 6% of their annual revenue, which does not put a ton of pressure on Mark Zuckerberg to act on. Plus, some companies have pulled their ads for a month; some put their ads on an indefinite “pause.” Some pulled their ads from Facebook only; others pulled them from Twitter and YouTube as well. </p>
          <p>Facebook spokesperson Tom Channick confirmed the accuracy of the remarks.</p>
          <p><strong>&quot;We take these matters very seriously and respect the feedback from our partners. We&#39;re making real progress keeping hate speech off our platform, and we don&#39;t benefit from this kind of content. But as we&#39;ve said, we make policy changes based on principles, not revenue pressures.&quot;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>What happens next...</strong></p>
          <p>Facebook has over 100 billion posts and ads posted on various platforms (Facebook and Instagram) every day. They claim that only a small percentage are hateful or misleading, but still a small fraction of 100 billion a day is still significantly high.</p>
          <p>Facebook might change its policies or it might not. Whether this campaign has any effect is yet to be seen. But, this surely causes damage to the reputation of the company after coming under the microscope again for the wrong reasons. The growth of this campaign will play a big role in the coming months as it aims to target Facebook where it hurts the most, its wallet. Other companies like Twitter and Google might benefit from the whole growing outrage.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I would like to say that a change in the world of technology is due. Data is the most valuable asset on the planet, and the world is growing online at the speed of light. A lot of changes need to be brought about to not only secure our sensitive data, but also to prevent the wrongful spread of hate speeches and misleading ads on social media platforms. The rise in concern over these issues will eventually force the big players in the social media space to act and prevent their platform from being as a place of hate and distrust.</p>
          <p>Social media aims to connect people across the globe. It should be used to make our world better and to spread positivity, not hate.</p>
